# LLM Serve Dashboard

A single-file, dependency-free live dashboard for your local LLM serving box — GPU utilization,
per-model throughput, KV/context fill, and system stats for **llama.cpp** and **vLLM**, in one
green terminal-styled page.

No framework, no build step, no external requests. The frontend is one `index.html`; the backend is
one stdlib Python file that reads `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA) or amdgpu sysfs (AMD) and each
server's Prometheus `/metrics` — and also
serves the page, so the dashboard is same-origin and needs no CORS grant.

*(Screenshot rendered from the committed `docs/example-metrics.json` fixture — no real hardware,
model names or network data. Plug in your own box and it goes live.)*

Regenerate it yourself, so the caption above is checkable rather than something you take on trust:

```bash
FLEET_METRICS_FIXTURE=docs/example-metrics.json python3 fleet-metrics.py &
chromium --headless --window-size=2880,1640 --virtual-time-budget=9000 \
         --screenshot=docs/screenshot.png http://localhost:8092/
```

## What it shows

- **GPUs** — per-card utilization, VRAM, power, temperature, clocks, and the compute tenants on
  each card. NVIDIA labels come from `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` (ground truth); AMD's
  driver exposes no per-process VRAM, so the worker is *attributed* to the card holding VRAM and
  shown with a `~` prefix. Also the **negotiated PCIe link** and any **active throttle
  reason**: a card sitting at `GEN3 x1 of x16` or capped at `sw_power_cap` looks perfectly healthy
  on every other gauge, and is usually the answer to "why is this one card slow?".
- **Primary worker** — decode & prefill tokens/sec, request counts, queue depth, context/KV fill.
  Works with llama.cpp (`/metrics` + `/props`) and vLLM (`/metrics` + `/v1/models`). The worker
  port is **auto-discovered** from listening sockets, so a bench or swap that moves the model to
  another port still lands on the dashboard.
- **Request latency** — mean TTFT, inter-token latency and queue wait over the last 30 seconds of
  completed requests. This one is **vLLM-only**, and the tile says so on llama.cpp rather than
  going blank: llama.cpp's exporter publishes eleven series and none of them is a latency
  histogram, so a scraper cannot know what any single client waited. (`1000 / tokens-per-second`
  would look like inter-token latency, but it is an average across every batched slot, not one
  client's experience — this dashboard doesn't print it.) Measuring latency under llama.cpp needs
  something in the request path; see the Rust build below.
- **Secondary servers** — an optional row of cards for extra llama-servers running **on this same
  machine**, each on its own port (a small CPU model, a second engine, etc.). LoRA adapters are
  shown per secondary card. Configure with `SECONDARY_SERVERS`.
- **Network** — per-NIC rx/tx rates with a session total, plus a passive LAN view (ARP table and
  established connections; no scanning). RAM and load average are collected and returned on
  `/metrics` for other consumers, but the page has no panel for them.
- **Model library** — a browsable inventory of your loadable models with quant, ctx, and measured
  throughput, driven by a JSON registry you edit.
- **Reasoning tap (optional)** — off by default. Point `THOUGHT_LOG` at a log of streamed
  `reasoning_content` and the panel shows its live tail. Separate per-request CoT panels require a
  proxy serving structured streams at `/thoughts` on `:8090`; that proxy is **not** included here.

## Run it

> **First time here?** [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md) is the two-minute path: start it, confirm
> it worked, keep it running, and what to do when it doesn't. This section is the short
> version; the rest of this page is the reference.

Requirements: Python 3.8+ and `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA GPUs). No pip installs.

```bash
# 1. start the backend (serves the page AND the JSON on :8092)
python3 fleet-metrics.py

# 2. open the dashboard
xdg-open http://localhost:8092/
```

The page polls `/metrics` on its own origin for live data. That's it.

**Port already taken?** `:8092` is a popular port. Move it:

```bash
FLEET_METRICS_PORT=9100 python3 fleet-metrics.py
```

The page follows automatically — it polls its own origin, so there is nothing else to change.
If the port is busy you get a one-line message telling you so, not a traceback.

> Opening `index.html` directly from `file://` no longer works, deliberately. A `file://` page has
> `Origin: null`, and so does every sandboxed iframe — granting it would let any page that can
> embed one read your telemetry. Serving the page from the backend makes it same-origin instead.

### Point it at your servers

By default it looks for a llama.cpp/vLLM server on `:8001` (then `:8010`, `:8123`). Override:

```bash
# candidate ports for the primary worker.
# :8001 wins outright if it answers; otherwise the responder with the largest ctx wins.
WORKER_PORT_CANDIDATES=8000,8001,8080 python3 fleet-metrics.py

# secondary servers shown as extra cards: label:port,label:port
# The label is only a display name — every port is fetched on THIS machine (localhost).
# There is no remote-host support; pointing a label at another box will not reach it.
SECONDARY_SERVERS='cpu-a:9093,cpu-b:9095' python3 fleet-metrics.py

# model library source (defaults to the bundled models-registry.json)
MODELS_REGISTRY=~/my-models.json python3 fleet-metrics.py

# optional reasoning/CoT panel: tail a log of streamed reasoning_content
THOUGHT_LOG=~/thinking.log python3 fleet-metrics.py
```

Also update the matching `SECONDARY_META` list near the bottom of `index.html` so the secondary
cards render with your names.

## How it works

`fleet-metrics.py` is a tiny `http.server` on `:8092` exposing:

- `GET /` — the dashboard page itself, so it loads same-origin.
- `GET /metrics` — the full JSON blob the dashboard renders (GPUs, worker, secondaries, system).
- `GET /models` — the model-library registry.
- `GET /health` — liveness.

llama.cpp publishes ready-made rate gauges (`prompt_tokens_seconds`, `predicted_tokens_seconds`)
alongside its cumulative counters, and those gauges are read directly. vLLM has no such gauges, so
its rates are derived from deltas between cumulative counters across polls. All parsing is stdlib.

### Held numbers say how old they are

Both engines only report throughput and latency *while they are working*: llama.cpp's rate gauges
drop to 0 the moment a generation ends, and vLLM's latency histograms simply stop advancing. Both
failure modes are ugly — a server that answered a request two seconds ago should not read `0.0
tok/s`, and a burst from an hour ago should not read as the current rate.

So a value with no fresh reading behind it is **held with its age** — the tile shows `38.7 tok/s`
while live and `38.7 tok/s · 12s ago` once the engine goes quiet — and the hold **expires after 60
seconds** rather than lingering forever. A server that goes down drops its held values immediately,
so a restart onto a different model can never inherit the previous model's numbers.

## Python or Rust? Two builds

This repo is the **Python build** — the zero-setup, read-the-whole-thing-in-one-file version. There
is also a **Rust build, [fleet-tap](https://github.com/Forge-the-Kingdom/fleet-tap)**, which is a
transparent traffic *tap* rather than just a metrics scraper. They render the same dashboard; they
differ in how they get the numbers and what they cost to run.

**Use the Python build (this repo) when:**
- You want it running in ten seconds: `python3 fleet-metrics.py`, no toolchain, no compile step.
- You watch one box with one or a handful of servers.
- You'd rather read and hack a single stdlib file than a Rust crate.
- You don't want anything sitting in front of your serving ports — this only ever *reads* each
  server's `/metrics`, never proxies traffic.

**Use the Rust build ([fleet-tap](https://github.com/Forge-the-Kingdom/fleet-tap)) when:**
- You want **accurate, client-measured throughput and latency.** It measures real tokens/sec, TTFT
  and inter-token latency from the actual request/response stream it taps. A scraper can only
  report what the engine chooses to publish: this build holds llama.cpp's idle-zero rate gauges
  and labels them with an age, but it still cannot produce per-request latency for llama.cpp at
  all, because llama.cpp exports no latency histogram to scrape.
- You run **many endpoints** and want live per-endpoint traffic streaming, **SSE push** (the browser
  stops polling), and **on-disk retention/history**.
- You want a single compiled binary with hot-reloadable config (add an endpoint, no restart).
- You accept the tradeoff: fleet-tap works by **holding each canonical serving port and forwarding
  to the engine on `port+10000`**, so it's a bit more setup and it sits in the request path (a
  fleet-tap crash interrupts serving until it restarts). Fine on a box you fully control; more than
  a casual "just show me the GPUs" tool needs.

Short version: **Python for the quick, side-car glance at one box; Rust for the always-on tap on a
busy multi-model rig.**

## Notes

- **AMD hero view.** A `CLASSIC | AMD` toggle in the nav (or `?view=amd`, persisted in
  localStorage) switches to a per-card hero layout — card telemetry paired with the worker it
  serves — in an AMD-red theme. The classic view is the default and is untouched.
- **Local-first / no phone-home.** No CDNs, no web fonts, no analytics, no external requests of any
  kind. Every request the page makes goes to its own origin: `/metrics` on a 2-second poll, plus
  `/models` once for the model library.
- **Loopback by default.** The metrics server binds `127.0.0.1:8092`. `/metrics` reports GPU
  tenants, system stats, ARP neighbours and established connections, so it is not something to put
  on a network implicitly. To reach it from another machine, opt in and put your own auth or tunnel
  in front of it — it is read-only telemetry, but it is unauthenticated:

  ```bash
  FLEET_METRICS_BIND=0.0.0.0 python3 fleet-metrics.py
  ```

- **DNS-rebinding guard.** Requests are refused unless the `Host` header is a loopback name.
  This is separate from CORS on purpose: a page at `http://rebind.example:8092` whose DNS flips
  to `127.0.0.1` becomes *same-origin* with this server, so no CORS check is even consulted, and
  binding to loopback doesn't help because the request comes from your own browser. The `Host`
  header is what still gives it away. Reaching the dashboard by a real hostname? Name it:

  ```bash
  FLEET_METRICS_ALLOWED_HOSTS=box.lan python3 fleet-metrics.py
  ```

- **Same-origin by default; CORS is an allowlist, never `*`.** The backend serves the page, so the
  dashboard's own fetches need no CORS grant at all. For anything else the server reflects only
  `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`[::1]` origins and sends no CORS header to the rest. This matters even
  on loopback: with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, any website you happened to visit could read
  your box's metrics via XHR from your own browser — binding to loopback does not prevent that.
  Serving `index.html` from somewhere else? Add its origin:

  ```bash
  FLEET_METRICS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.0.2.10:8080 python3 fleet-metrics.py
  ```
